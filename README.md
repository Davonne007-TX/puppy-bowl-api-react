#Block 29: Putting it all together

- The API
You can find the documentation for our "Puppy Bowl" API hereLinks to an external site.. You have seen this before, but it is a good idea to re-read through it to remember what routes are available to you to call, and what type of data you'll be working with in this project.

- Summing It Up
Your job, as the web developer for a site like this, will be to handle the data about each of our puppy competitors and their owners. To that purpose, you'll be interacting with the "Puppy Bowl" API we've built that hosts the data you'll need about each puppy, each of their owners, and even the teams they are on. You will make certain requests to our API to get the appropriate data you'll need, save that to the state of your React app, and then build various React components to visually represent that state to your users.

- Functional Requirements
    Your site's users should be able to...

    1. See a list of each player competing in the bowl.
    2. Click a "See Details" button or something similar on each player that will lead you to another  page view with specific details on that player, such as owner and team name.

    3. Have a form to CREATE a new player
    4. Search for a specific player in a search bar and see a new list with only puppies with names that match the text in the search bar.
    5. Create a button to DELETE a player (ONLY DELETE PLAYERS YOU YOURSELF CREATE PLEASE!)
